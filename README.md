# ConferenceProgram

Create a conference program from a spreadsheet specification. There is
an example spreadsheet available, with a conference invented together
with ChatGPT. The example sheet also contains instructions on how to
format your data.

The conference program and the author list can be converted to html 
pages, pdf files or Microsoft Word compatible docx files.
